# Breakout
A simple breakout game implemented using C#, MonoGame, and Jetbrain's Rider

This is based on a Java program I wrote a while ago, and thought it would be a good starting point in learning MonoGame.

The game engine is heavily influenced by the book Monogame Mastery by Jarred Capellman and Louis Salin.
